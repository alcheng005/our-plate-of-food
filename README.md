# WhereToEat

When you're with a group of friends or with an SO, sometimes it can be hard to
choose where you want to eat. People want to be considerate of each other and
nobody wants to be the one to to choose, or one person is offering ideas and
another person is shooting them down. Well, let me introduce you to...

## _🍴🍛🍣🍜 WhereToEat 🍕🍔🌮🍴_

With **WhereToEat** you will no longer have to struggle picking a place to
eat. When you load up the app, you will be presented with two options:

1. Create a Room
1. Join a Room

If you are the first person in your group to load up the app, select the
_Create a Room_ option and you will be put into a room with a randomly generated
code. You can then give this room code to anyone you want and they can load up
the app and select the _Join a Room_ option.

When someone is in the room, they can begin adding and removing locations of
**WhereToEat** to the shared food list. Once the food list is finalized and
every person who wants to vote is in the room, you can select the _Begin Voting_
option. This will take everyone to the voting process. Every person will then be
presented with every location one-at-a-time of **WhereToEat** and will have to
vote _Yes_, _No_, or _Maybe_. Once all the votes are in everyone will be taken
to the results and can see the rankings of each location, and hopefully, this
will help your group decide **WhereToEat**.
