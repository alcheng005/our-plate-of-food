# Our Plate Of Food

When you're with a group of friends or with an SO, sometimes it can be hard to
choose a place to eat that satisfies everyone's cup of tea. Either people want
to be considerate of each other and nobody wants to be the one to to choose, or
one person is offering ideas and another person is shooting them down. Well, let
 me introduce you to...

## _🍽️🍛🍣🍜 Our Plate Of Food 🍕🍔🌮🍽️_

With **Our Plate Of Food** you will no longer have to struggle picking a place
to eat. When you load up the app, you will be presented with two options:

1. _Create a Room_
1. _Join a Room_

If you are the first person in your group to load up the app, select the
_Create a Room_ option and you will be put into a room with a randomly generated
code. You can then give this room code to anyone you want and they can load up
the app and select the _Join a Room_ option.

When someone is in the room, they can begin adding and removing locations to eat
at to the **Our Plate Of Food** list. Once the food list is finalized and every
person who wants to vote is in the room, you can select the _Begin Voting_
option. This will take everyone to the voting process. Every person will then be
presented with every location one-at-a-time from the list and will have to vote
using one of the three options:

* _Yes_
* _Maybe_
* _No_

Once all the votes are in everyone will be taken to the results and can see the
rankings of each location. Hopefully, this will help your group decide what's
**Our Plate Of Food**.
